# REALISTIC-LOAN-APPROVAL-INSIGHT-VISUALISATION
##I am a data analytics student with a strong interest in transforming raw financial data into meaningful insights that support informed decision-making. Through practical projects, I apply analytical thinking, visualization tools, and storytelling techniques to solve real-world business problems—particularly in finance and lending systems.
🎯 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing loan approval patterns using realistic financial and demographic data. The goal is to identify the key factors that influence whether a loan application is approved or rejected, and to present these insights through clear, interactive visualizations.
The dashboard simulates how banks and financial institutions evaluate loan applications to minimize risk and improve approval accuracy.
📂 Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project includes the following variables:
Applicant ID
Loan Status (Approved / Rejected)
Annual Income
Credit Score
Loan Amount
Total Credit
Employment Duration (Years Employed)
Year
These variables reflect common criteria used in real-world loan approval systems.
🔍 Key Analytical Questions Answered
What is the overall loan approval rate?
How does credit score affect loan approval decisions?
What is the relationship between annual income and loan approval?
Does a higher loan amount reduce approval chances?
How does employment duration influence approval outcomes?
What trends exist in loan approvals over time?
